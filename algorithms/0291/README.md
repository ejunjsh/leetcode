# Word Pattern II
 

Given a pattern and a string str, find if strfollows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: pattern = pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc"
Output: false
Notes:
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
