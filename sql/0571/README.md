# Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

The numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

    +-------+----------+
    | Number| Frequency|
    +-------+----------+
    | 0     |   7      |
    | 1     |   1      |
    | 2     |   3      |
    | 3     |   1      |
    +-------+----------+


In this table, the numbers are `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3`, so the median is `(0+0)/2 =0`.

    +--------+
    | median |
    +--------+
    | 0.0000 |
    +--------+

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.
